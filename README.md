##  👩‍💻 A bit about me 

I'm a former mechanical engineer who recently fell in love with programming, always proudly geeky though. One of the hardest decisions I ever made was choosing between mechanical engineering and computer science. 🤔 As life is not a linear path, now is the time to redeem myself, and I couldn't be more committed to enjoying my software developer career to the fullest.
