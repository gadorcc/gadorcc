##  👩‍💻 A bit about me 

I'm an ex-mechanical engineer that recently fall in love badly with programming, always proudly geeky though. One of the harder decisions I ever made was choosing between mechanical engineering or computer science. 
🤔 As life is not a linear path, now is the time to redeem myself and I can't be more committed to enjoy my software developer career to the max.
